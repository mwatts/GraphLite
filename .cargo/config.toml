# GraphLite Cargo Configuration
# This file configures cargo behavior for the GraphLite project

[env]
# Parallel test execution is now enabled by default!
# The unified session architecture (Instance mode) ensures complete isolation
# between test instances, eliminating race conditions.
#
# Tests now run in parallel for ~10x speed improvement:
#   Before: 10-15 minutes (sequential)
#   After: 1.5 minutes (parallel with 16 threads)
#
# To run tests with a specific thread count:
#   RUST_TEST_THREADS=8 cargo test
