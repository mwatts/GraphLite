## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow these standards:

- **Treat everyone with respect** - We're building this together
- **Be constructive in feedback** - Focus on improvements, not criticism
- **Welcome newcomers** - Help new contributors get started
- **Collaborate openly** - Share knowledge and help others learn
- **Assume good intentions** - Give others the benefit of the doubt

---

## AI-Assisted Development Philosophy

GraphLite was built using modern AI-assisted development practices, leveraging **Claude Code by Anthropic** as a pair programming partner throughout the development process.

### Our Philosophy

We believe in **transparent, hybrid development** where AI and humans work together:

- **AI accelerates** coding, testing, and documentation
- **Humans provide** architecture design, goals, direction, and validation
- **Collaboration produces** faster and better results

### AI Use in Contributions

We believe in **full transparency** about AI involvement and **welcome AI-assisted contributions**.

**If you use AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) in your contributions:**

**Allowed:**
- Using AI to write boilerplate code
- AI-generated tests and documentation
- AI assistance with debugging and optimization
- Using AI to learn and understand the codebase

**Required:**
- **Human reviews all AI-generated code** - You must understand what the code does
- **Design documentation** - Provide a concise, readable design doc explaining your approach
- **Automated tests** - Add comprehensive test suites
- **Manual testing** - Include a script of manual tests run along with results
- **Take ownership** - You are responsible for code quality and correctness

**Not Allowed:**
- Copy-pasting AI code without understanding
- Submitting code with "the AI said it works" as the only verification
- PRs without tests or documentation
- Code that violates architectural patterns specified in [Critical Rules](#critical-rules).

**Transparency:**
- You may mention AI tools used in PR descriptions (optional for small changes)
- Be transparent about AI use for significant contributions
- Your contributions will be licensed under Apache-2.0
- You retain copyright on your contributions

**Remember:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for engineering judgment. We value well-designed, thoroughly tested contributions over speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** (1.70 or higher): Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git**: For version control

```

### Suggesting Features

We love feature ideas! Before suggesting:
1. **Check the roadmap**: It might already be planned ([docs/ROADMAP.md](../docs/ROADMAP.md))
2. **Check existing feature requests**: Search open issues
3. **Consider scope**: Does it fit GraphLite's vision as an embedded graph DB?

### Contributing Code

We accept pull requests for:
- **Bug fixes**: Always welcome!
- **Documentation improvements**: Documentation correction and more examples
- **Test improvements**: Better coverage, edge cases
- **Performance optimizations**: With benchmarks showing improvement
- **New features**: Discuss in an issue first (before coding)

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guide

GraphLite follows the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/) and standard Rust conventions:

#### Formatting
```bash
# Auto-format all code
cargo fmt --all

# Check formatting without modifying
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

#### Linting
```bash
# Run Clippy linter
cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings

# Fix auto-fixable issues
cargo clippy --all --fix
```

#### Code Organization

- **Modules**: One file per module, clear separation of concerns
- **Visibility**: Use `pub(crate)` for internal APIs, `pub` only for public API
- **Error handling**: Use `Result<T, Error>` consistently, avoid `unwrap()` in library code
- **Documentation**: All public items must have doc comments

#### Naming Conventions

```rust
// Module names: snake_case
mod query_executor;

// Type names: PascalCase
struct QueryCoordinator;
enum StatementType;

// Functions and variables: snake_case
fn process_query() {}
let session_id = "...";

// Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_QUERY_SIZE: usize = 1024;

// Lifetimes: short, descriptive
fn parse<'a>(input: &'a str) -> Result<Node<'a>>;
```

#### Documentation Comments

```rust
/// Brief one-line description.
///
/// More detailed explanation if needed. Can include:
/// - Multiple paragraphs
/// - Examples
/// - Error conditions
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use graphlite::QueryCoordinator;
///
/// let coordinator = QueryCoordinator::from_path("./mydb")?;
/// let session = coordinator.create_simple_session("user")?;
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `Err` if:
/// - Database path is invalid
/// - Permissions are insufficient
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function panics if called from within an async context.
pub fn process_query(&self, query: &str) -> Result<String> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Critical Rules

GraphLite has the following specific architectural patterns that are expressed as rules below.
They can be enforced by using github hooks. Use [scripts/install_hooks.sh](../scripts/install_hooks.sh).

Key rules:

1. **ExecutionContext Management**: Never create new `ExecutionContext` instances
2. **Storage Manager Singleton**: Never create new `StorageManager` instances during query execution
3. **Read vs Write Locks**: Use read locks for read operations, write locks only for writes
4. **CatalogManager Singleton**: Get from session context, don't create new instances
5. **Async Runtime Management**: Don't create new Tokio runtimes repeatedly
6. **Helper Method Pattern**: Access fields directly, not recursively
7. **Async Context Detection**: Check if in async context before using `block_on()`
8. **Test Integrity**: Fix bugs in code, not in tests (unless test is wrong)
9. **Session Manager Isolation**: Use global SessionManager, don't create test-specific instances
10. **API Boundary**: Use `QueryCoordinator` as the only public API

**Before submitting a PR, verify your changes don't violate these rules.**

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

All contributions must include tests:

- **Bug fixes**: Add test that reproduces the bug (should fail before fix, pass after)
- **New features**: Unit tests + integration tests
- **Refactoring**: Existing tests must pass
- **Performance improvements**: Include benchmarks

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --all

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run tests in specific module
cargo test --package graphlite --lib ast::tests

# Run integration tests only
cargo test --test '*'

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test
```

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_query_parsing() {
        let query = "MATCH (n) RETURN n";
        let result = parse_query(query);
        assert!(result.is_ok());

        let statement = result.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(statement.statement_type, StatementType::Query);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_invalid_query() {
        let query = "INVALID SYNTAX";
        let result = parse_query(query);
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }
}
```

#### Integration Tests

```rust
// In tests/integration_test.rs
use graphlite::QueryCoordinator;
use tempfile::TempDir;

#[test]
fn test_create_and_query_graph() {
    let temp_dir = TempDir::new().unwrap();
    let coordinator = QueryCoordinator::from_path(temp_dir.path()).unwrap();
    let session = coordinator.create_simple_session("test_user").unwrap();

    // Create schema
    coordinator.process_query("CREATE SCHEMA /test", &session).unwrap();
    coordinator.process_query("USE SCHEMA /test", &session).unwrap();

    // Create graph and add data
    coordinator.process_query("CREATE GRAPH test_graph", &session).unwrap();
    coordinator.process_query(
        "INSERT (:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 30})",
        &session
    ).unwrap();

    // Query data
    let result = coordinator.process_query(
        "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.age",
        &session
    ).unwrap();

    assert!(result.contains("Alice"));
    assert!(result.contains("30"));
}
```

#### Test Isolation

Use the `TestFixture` pattern for integration tests:

```rust
use graphlite::test_utils::TestFixture;

#[test]
fn test_with_isolation() {
    let fixture = TestFixture::new().unwrap();

    // Each test gets unique schema/graph names
    fixture.execute("INSERT (:Node {id: 1})").unwrap();

    let result = fixture.query("MATCH (n) RETURN n").unwrap();
    assert_eq!(result.len(), 1);

    // Cleanup happens automatically when fixture drops
}
```
